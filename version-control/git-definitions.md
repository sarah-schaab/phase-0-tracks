# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a record of the changes to a file or multiples files in Git. It's useful because you can go back in time to recall specific versions from the past.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a "copy"  of the main project in your git repository. You would use a branch to individually create new features to check if they work before adding to or changing your Master branch.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a message that describes how you changed the branch or file that you are working on. A good commit message includes detailed information about what is changed, the author and a time stamp.

* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict occurs when there are two or more disagreeing changes to your branches.
