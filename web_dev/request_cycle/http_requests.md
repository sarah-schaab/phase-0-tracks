#What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

* POST request supply additional data from the client to the server in the message body. In contrast,
* GET requests include all required data in the URL.

* Forms in HTML can use either method by specifying method="POST" or method="GET" (default) in the <form> element.

# what is a cookie and how does it relate to http requests
* An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server.
* Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example
