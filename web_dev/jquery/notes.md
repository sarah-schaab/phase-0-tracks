## How I plan to tackle jQuery to learn as much as I can in two hours:

* APPLY IT TO SOMETHING I KNOW ALREADY (HTML)
- use the website that I built in week two and three of DBC to apply jQuery to really see it in action..
* use resources like the official documentation of jQuery.
- http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
* Checkout codecademy for a quick tour.
* WIKIpedia
*Stackoverflow
*general google questions

# I Think that in the beginning I will test more frequently. Probably after each adjustment is made, that way I can learn by using jQuery. After I am used to using it, I will probably test more infrequently.

# I would like to take a break every 30 minutes that way I have enough time to let the topics of jQuery set in. This will take my total time to 3.5 hours
