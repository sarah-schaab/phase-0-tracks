## How I plan to tackle JQuery to learn as much as I can in two hours:

* APPLY IT TO SOMETHING I KNOW ALREADY (HTML)
- use the website that I built in week two and three of DBC to apply jQuery to really see it in action..
* use resources like the official documentation of jQuery.
- http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
* Checkout codecademy for a quick tour.
* WIKIpedia
*Stackoverflow
*general google questions
