#I've successfully been able to loop the program to the number of times entered
#and I've successfully been able to ask about allergies and loop it until it breaks.
#but
# I'm having a lot of trouble running the logic section, I can understand which questions to ask but I can't get them to run properly, and I know that it is because I am missing some aspect of the conditions of the if/elsif/else statements. Do you think you could help me
